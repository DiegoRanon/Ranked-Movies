# 🎬 Ranked Movies (React.js Project)

**Ranked Movies** is a React.js application that allows users to search for movies, view search results, and manage a personal list of watched movies with custom ratings.

This project was built to **practice core React fundamentals**, including component composition, prop drilling, reusability, and state management. It also features a **reusable Star Rating component** and a clean, split-component layout structure.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔎 **Search Functionality** – Search for movies in real-time
- 📋 **Search Results List** – Displays movies with posters and release years
- ⭐ **Watched Movies Tracker** – Log watched movies with IMDb ratings and personal user ratings
- 📊 **Summary Statistics** – Average IMDb rating, average user rating, and average runtime
- 🧩 **Reusable Components** – Modular design with reusable `Box`, `Movie`, `WatchedMovie`, and `StarRating` components
- 🔄 **Interactive Layout** – Expand and collapse sections dynamically
- 🎨 **Clean and Responsive UI**

- **React.js** – Frontend framework
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Modern syntax and array operations
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive layout
- **React Hooks** – `useState` for state management

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand and apply **component-driven architecture** in React
- Practice **composition**: assembling a UI from small, reusable components
- Learn about **prop drilling** and the importance of component hierarchy
- Build **flexible layouts** by composing custom components
- Create a **reusable Star Rating component** for other future projects

## 🧠 What I Learned
Structuring React apps with composition instead of deep nesting

Handling prop drilling cleanly to pass data across layers

Building expandable/collapsible layouts for better user experience

Creating reusable and generic components (e.g., Box, StarRating)

Managing simple UI logic (like dynamic movie statistics) with functional programming
